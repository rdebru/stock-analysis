# **VBA of Wall Street**
	
## **Overview of Project** 
* Steve's parents are passinate about green energy.There are more green energy stocks to invest in, however they decided to invest all their money into DAQO New Energy Corp.DAQo's ticker symbol is `DQ`. Steve wants to help his parents and he decided to analyze a handfull of green energy stocks inaddition to DAQO's stocks as he is concerned about diversifying their funds. By automating the analysis of the stock data, we will help steve to reuse code with any stock and as well reduce chance of accidents and errors. Steve will be able to see the results of the analysis with a click of button for all the stocks and for any year.

 
### Purpose 
 
* Edit and refactor Module2_VBA_Script so we loop through the data one time and collect all of the information for all the stocks with a click of a button and for years 2017 and 2018. Also measure code performance between the refactored VBA scrpt and the original script.As well to creat a summay report based on your analysis and finding of the refactored VBA script and the original script of the module.



## **Results** 

![Elapsed run time for Output 2017](C:/Users/Ruth/OneDrive/Desktop/Class_Work/Module_2/HW2_Submission_ExcelVBA/Resources/VBA_Challenge_2017.png) 

![Elapsed run time for Output 2018](C:/Users/Ruth/OneDrive/Desktop/Class_Work/Module_2/HW2_Submission_ExcelVBA/Resources/VBA_Challenge_2018.png) 

* we can see from the images above that the time to run the refactored Script for the outputs of year 2017 and year 2018 is faster than original script of the module.Images for the elapsed run time of the Original script are on `All Stocks Analysis` worksheet of the VBA_Challenge.
 
## **Summary** 

1. What are the advantages or disadvantages of refactoring code? 

* Advantages  

	* to make the code more efficient—by taking fewer steps
	* using less memory
	* improving the logic of the code to make it easier for 		future users to read
	* less complex and easier to maintain. 
	* refactoring is very common as first attempt to write the code might not be the bast solution, you always look for simpler and cleaaner and effeint code.

* Disadvantages
	* if refactoring is not done properly, it might introduce new bugs and might not be effient but it becomes more complicated instead of simpler and easy to read 
 

2. How do these pros and cons apply to refactoring the original VBA script?
